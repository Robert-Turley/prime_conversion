# Prime Conversion project
## **Special thanks to Tyler Thibault for help with implementing the JS code for the PM algorithms at prime-mechanics.com

<br>

The project objective is to utilize the algorithms presented by PM to allow users to perform the following three options:
- Convert natural numbers to prime notation
- Convert number sequences to prime notation
- Render 2D images for irrational values (for example, Pi in Base-10 to 1000 digits/HORIZONTAL RIGHT and multipled by 1000/VERTICAL UP, converted to prime notation and shaded by value)
